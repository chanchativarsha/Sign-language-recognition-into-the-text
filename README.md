# Sign-language-recognition-into-the-text
Sign language is primarily used by the deaf and mute, making communication with non-signers challenging. To bridge this gap, a Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system is designed to enhance communication. It captures sign expressions from a hearing-impaired person and converts them into text or voice for easy understanding by others.
